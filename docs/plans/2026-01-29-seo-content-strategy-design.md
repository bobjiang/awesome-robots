### Velite Configuration Enhancement

**Existing Velite Setup:** Already supports blog posts via `velite.config.ts`

**Enhanced Frontmatter Schema for Guides:**

```typescript
// content/blog/guides/[slug].md frontmatter
---
title: "Complete Humanoid Robot Buying Guide 2026"
slug: "humanoid-robot-buying-guide-2026"
author: "bob-jiang"
date: "2026-02-15"
category: "guides"  // NEW category for guides
tags: ["humanoid", "buying-guide", "2026", "comprehensive"]
excerpt: "Ultimate 5000-word guide to choosing the perfect humanoid robot in 2026. Compare 75+ models, detailed buying criteria, expert recommendations for every use case and budget."
featured: true
published: true
contentType: "guide"  // NEW field to distinguish from blog posts
wordCount: 4500
readingTime: 18  // minutes
seo:
  title: "Humanoid Robot Buying Guide 2026 | Compare 75+ Models"
  description: "Comprehensive guide to buying humanoid robots in 2026. Compare 75+ models, pricing, specifications. Expert recommendations for research, enterprise, and hobbyists."
  keywords: ["humanoid robot buying guide", "best humanoid robots 2026", "how to buy humanoid robot", "humanoid robot comparison", "humanoid robot prices"]
---
```

**Velite Processing:**
- Guides use same Velite processing as blog posts
- Compiled to `.velite/posts.json` with other blog content
- Full type safety and MDX support
- Schema validation via Zod

### URL Structure

**Decision: Keep guides under `/blog` for SEO authority consolidation**

**URL Pattern:**
- `/blog/humanoid-robot-buying-guide-2026`
- `/blog/quadruped-robot-buyers-guide-2026`
- `/blog/enterprise-humanoid-robots-guide`
- etc.

**Rationale:**
- Consolidates domain authority under `/blog` path
- Simpler to implement (uses existing routing)
- Aligns with content marketing best practices
- Easier internal linking structure

**Alternative Considered (not chosen):**
- `/guides/[slug]` - Separate section
- Pros: Clear separation, dedicated navigation
- Cons: Splits domain authority, requires new route setup
- Decision: Stay with `/blog` for now, can migrate later if needed

### Dynamic Data Integration

Guides will pull live data from `robots.json` for comparison tables and recommendations.

**MDX Component Usage in Guides:**

```markdown
<!-- In guide markdown content -->

## Top Humanoid Robots Comparison

<RobotComparisonTable
  robotIds={["unitree-g1", "figure-02", "tesla-optimus", "agility-digit", "boston-dynamics-atlas"]}
  compareFields={["price", "height", "weight", "dof", "battery", "payload"]}
  sortBy="price"
/>

## Recommended Robots by Budget

<BudgetTierRecommendations
  category="humanoid"
  tiers={[
    { label: "Entry Level", max: 20000 },
    { label: "Mid-Range", min: 20000, max: 50000 },
    { label: "Premium", min: 50000, max: 100000 },
    { label: "Enterprise", min: 100000 }

### SEO Enhancements

#### Article Schema (Auto-Generated)

Velite already handles Article schema for blog posts. Guides inherit this:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Complete Humanoid Robot Buying Guide 2026",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Bob Jiang"
  },
  "datePublished": "2026-02-15",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Awesome Robots",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://www.awesomerobots.xyz/logo.png"
    }
  },
  "wordCount": 4500,
  "articleSection": "guides",
  "keywords": ["humanoid robot buying guide", ...]
}
```

#### FAQ Schema (Manual Addition)

Add FAQ schema manually to each guide using existing `structured-data.ts` functions:

```typescript
// In guide page component
import { generateFAQSchema } from '@/lib/structured-data';

const faqData = [
  {
    question: "How much does a humanoid robot cost?",
    answer: "Humanoid robot prices range from $16,000 (Unitree G1) to over $250,000 (Boston Dynamics Atlas). Most research-grade humanoids cost $20,000-$50,000, while enterprise platforms range $50,000-$150,000."
  },
  // ... more FAQ pairs
];

const faqSchema = generateFAQSchema(faqData);
```

#### Breadcrumb Schema

```typescript
// Breadcrumb for guides
Home > Blog > Guides > [Guide Title]

const breadcrumbItems = [
  { name: 'Home', url: '/' },
  { name: 'Blog', url: '/blog' },
  { name: 'Guides', url: '/blog?category=guides' },
  { name: guide.title, url: `/blog/${guide.slug}` }
];
```

#### Dynamic OG Images

Create OG image generator for guides following existing pattern:

**File:** `src/app/blog/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx`

Enhance to detect guide type and customize:

```typescript
// For guides, show:
// - "Ultimate Guide" or "Buying Guide" label
// - Guide title
// - Word count and reading time
// - "Compare X+ robots" badge
// - Awesome Robots branding

export default async function Image({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const guide = await getGuideBySlug(params.slug);

  if (guide.contentType === 'guide') {
    return new ImageResponse(
      (
        <div style={{
          background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)',
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          flexDirection: 'column',
          justifyContent: 'center',
          alignItems: 'center',
          padding: '60px',
        }}>
          <div style={{ fontSize: 32, color: 'white', opacity: 0.9 }}>
            {guide.category === 'guides' ? '📚 Ultimate Guide' : '📰 Article'}
          </div>
          <div style={{ fontSize: 72, fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'white', textAlign: 'center', marginTop: 20 }}>
            {guide.title}
          </div>
          <div style={{ fontSize: 32, color: 'white', opacity: 0.8, marginTop: 40 }}>
            {guide.wordCount} words · {guide.readingTime} min read
          </div>
          <div style={{ fontSize: 28, color: 'white', opacity: 0.9, marginTop: 20 }}>
            Awesome Robots
          </div>
        </div>
      ),
      {
        width: 1200,
        height: 630,
      }
    );
  }

  // Regular blog post OG image
  // ...
}
```

## Section 8: Content Maintenance, Measurement & Success Metrics

### Content Maintenance Strategy

#### Quarterly Updates (Every 3 Months)

**Review Cycle:**
- Schedule: 1st week of March, June, September, December
- Duration: 4-6 hours per guide (36-54 hours total for all 9)

**Update Checklist per Guide:**
- [ ] Review all robot specifications for accuracy
- [ ] Update pricing (check current prices in robots.json)
- [ ] Update availability status (in stock, discontinued, waitlist)
- [ ] Add newly released robots to comparison tables
- [ ] Refresh market statistics and context
- [ ] Update year references (e.g., "2026" → "2027" annually)
- [ ] Check and fix broken links (internal and external)
- [ ] Verify manufacturer website links still valid
- [ ] Update screenshots if UI/products changed significantly
- [ ] Refresh case studies or examples if available

**Version Control:**
- Add changelog comment at bottom of each guide
- Track major updates in git commit messages
- Example: "2026-06-01: Added 5 new humanoids, updated pricing for Unitree G1 and Figure 02"

#### Triggered Updates (Event-Based)

**Major Robot Launches (within 1 week):**
- Add new robot to relevant guide comparison tables
- Update market context section
- Adjust recommendations if new robot changes landscape
- Example triggers: New Boston Dynamics humanoid, Tesla Optimus commercial release, breakthrough Chinese platform

**Significant Price Changes (within 48 hours):**
- Update pricing in comparison tables
- Adjust budget tier recommendations if needed
- Note price changes in market context
- Example triggers: Unitree announces price drop, enterprise platform pricing becomes public

**Discontinued Products:**
- Mark clearly in comparison tables (strikethrough, "Discontinued" badge)
- Suggest alternatives in same price/capability range
- Keep historical context (helps with SEO for old searches)
- Update "best for X" recommendations if discontinued product was recommended

**Technology Breakthroughs:**
- Update technology sections in deep-dive guides
- Add new evaluation criteria if relevant (e.g., new sensor technology)
- Refresh AI integration sections for Guide 11

#### Evergreen Strategy

**Annual Year Updates:**
- Every January, update all "2026" references to current year
- Refresh statistics and market data
- Update trend predictions
- Comprehensive review of all technology sections

**Stable Content (Rarely Changes):**
- Core buying criteria principles (budget, use case, technical requirements)
- Decision frameworks
- Basic technology explanations (bipedal locomotion, quadruped gaits)

**Dynamic Content (Frequent Updates):**
- Product comparison tables (quarterly minimum)
- Pricing information (as needed)
- Market statistics and trends (quarterly)
- Technology bleeding-edge sections (monthly for Guide 11)

### Dynamic Component Benefits

**Auto-Update Advantages:**
If using dynamic `<RobotComparisonTable>` components that pull from robots.json:

- ✅ Pricing updates automatically when robots.json is updated
- ✅ New robots appear automatically if added to specified category
- ✅ Specifications always current (no manual table editing)
- ✅ Reduces maintenance burden from 36-54 hours to 10-15 hours quarterly

**Static Table Trade-offs:**
If using static markdown tables:
- ❌ Manual updates required for every change
- ✅ Full editorial control over what's shown
- ✅ Can add custom notes and context
- ❌ More time-consuming maintenance

**Recommendation:** Use dynamic components for large comparison tables, static tables for curated "top picks" sections.

### Monitoring & Optimization Process

#### Weekly Check-In (15 minutes)

**Dashboard Review:**
- Traffic spikes or drops? (investigate anomalies)
- Conversion rate stable? (quote requests per 1000 visitors)
- Any technical issues? (404s, broken links, indexing errors)

**Action Items:**
- Flag issues for deeper investigation
- Note any major ranking changes
- Quick wins (fix broken links, update outdated stats)

#### Monthly Deep Dive (1-2 hours)

**Analysis:**
1. Compare month-over-month metrics for each guide
2. Identify underperforming guides (low traffic, high bounce rate, low conversions)
3. Identify overperforming guides (learn what's working)
4. Check keyword ranking changes (wins and losses)
5. Review backlink growth (new links, lost links)
6. Analyze user behavior (scroll depth, click patterns, exit pages)

**Optimization Priorities:**
1. Underperforming guides: Diagnose issue (poor keyword targeting? Weak content? Low rankings?)
2. Quick wins: Update meta descriptions, improve CTAs, add internal links
3. Content gaps: Identify keywords we should target but aren't
4. Technical SEO: Fix any crawl errors, schema issues, broken links

**Documentation:**
- Update monthly SEO report
- Share insights with team
- Plan next month's optimization tasks

#### Quarterly Strategic Review (3-4 hours)

**Comprehensive Analysis:**
1. ROI calculation: Traffic growth, conversion growth, business impact
2. Competitive analysis: How do we rank vs competitors?
3. Content freshness: Which guides need major updates?
4. Strategy adjustment: Double down on what's working, cut what's not
5. New opportunities: New keywords to target, new guide topics to create

**Strategic Decisions:**
- Should we create more guides (10-15 total)?
- Should we invest in video content for guides?
- Should we create interactive tools (robot selector quiz, ROI calculator)?
- Should we do paid promotion for underperforming guides?

**Planning:**
- Update content calendar for next quarter
- Allocate resources for content updates
- Set new stretch goals

### Success Validation & ROI

**6-Month ROI Calculation Example:**

**Investment:**
- Content creation: 180 hours × $100/hour = $18,000
- Component development: 40 hours × $150/hour = $6,000
- Total investment: $24,000

**Returns (Conservative Estimate):**
- Organic traffic increase: +8,000 monthly visitors
- Quote requests from guides: 150/month
- Average quote value: $30,000 (conservative for robots)
- Close rate: 5% (conservative for high-ticket B2B)
- Monthly revenue from guides: 150 × $30,000 × 5% = $225,000
- 6-month total revenue: $1,350,000

**ROI:** 5,525% (even with conservative estimates)

**Actual business impact may vary, but even at 10% of these numbers, ROI is strong.**
