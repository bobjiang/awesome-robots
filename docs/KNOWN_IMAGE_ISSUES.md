# Known Image Issues

## Images Needing Replacement

The following robot images are currently using placeholder images and need to be replaced with official product photos:

### Petoi Robots
- **Bittle** (`petoi-bittle.webp`) - Currently showing Xiaomi promotional material
- **Nybble** (`petoi-nybble.webp`) - Currently showing Xiaomi promotional material

Note: Official Petoi product images were not available from freely-licensed sources at the time of initial data entry. These should be updated with proper product photos from official sources.

### Placeholder Images
The following robots are using placeholder images copied from similar robot types:
- **Honda ASIMO** (`honda-asimo.webp`)
- **Hyundai DAL-e** (`hyundai-dal-e.webp`)
- **LimX W1** (`limx-w1.webp`)
- **Weilan AlphaDog** (`weilan-alphadog.webp`)
- **Swiss-Mile RIVR** (`swiss-mile-rivr.webp`)

## Next Steps

1. Contact manufacturers for official press kit images
2. Search for Creative Commons licensed images on Wikimedia Commons
3. Consider creating custom placeholder graphics with robot silhouettes
4. Update image attribution in robots.json if using third-party images
