## Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Can do NOW)
1. **Add robots with current data:**
   - Robot names and Chinese brands
   - Product images (all hosted on Huawei Cloud CDN)
   - Basic descriptions
   - Links to OpenLoong for more info

2. **Add brand placeholders:**
   - Chinese manufacturer names
   - Default descriptions
   - Country: China
   - Status: "Needs enrichment"

**Result:** Expand your catalog by 20 robots from 16 new Chinese manufacturers immediately.

### Phase 2: Manual Enrichment (Recommended)
For each of the 16 new brands, research and add:
1. **Company official website**
2. **Company logo** (download and add to `/public/images/brands/`)
3. **English company name** (if available)
4. **Company description/background**

### Phase 3: Technical Specifications (Optional)
For high-priority robots, visit manufacturer websites to extract:
1. Dimensions (height, weight)
2. Degrees of Freedom (DoF)
3. Battery capacity and runtime
4. Sensors and interfaces
5. Software ecosystem (ROS support, SDKs)
6. Pricing (if publicly available)

## Image Hosting Notes

All 94 product images are currently hosted on:
```
https://openloong.obs.cn-east-3.myhuaweicloud.com/
```

### Options:
1. **Use CDN directly** - Add domain to `next.config.js` image patterns
2. **Download and host locally** - For better control and reliability
3. **Hybrid approach** - Use CDN initially, migrate later

**Recommendation:** Add CDN domain to `next.config.js` for quick integration:
```javascript
remotePatterns: [
  {
    protocol: 'https',
    hostname: 'openloong.obs.cn-east-3.myhuaweicloud.com',
    pathname: '/yellow-pages%2Fpublic%2Fimg/**',
  }
]
```
