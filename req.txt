Overview: This website will serve as a centralized catalog of AI-powered robots – ranging from humanoids to quadruped robot dogs – along with accessories and related products. The goal is to provide a rich, user-friendly browsing experience that informs and engages visitors, ultimately driving them to purchase through a quotation links (since the site will not handle direct sales or inventory). All features are designed to work without a custom backend, using static content generation and client-side interactivity. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key features and design considerations:

Product Listings:
Organizing products intuitively is critical. The site will allow users to explore robots in multiple ways:
	•	By Category: Visitors can navigate via high-level categories such as Humanoids, Quadrupeds, Accessories, and Others. Each category page will list relevant products (e.g. all humanoid robots on one page, all robot dog quadrupeds on another). This helps users quickly find the type of robot they’re interested in.
	•	The “Others” category will capture robots that don’t fit the main types (for example, wheeled robots, drones, robotic arms, etc.), ensuring comprehensive coverage of all AI robots in the catalog.
	•	Category pages will include brief descriptions of the category (e.g. what defines a humanoid vs a quadruped) to aid newcomers.
	•	By Brand: In addition to categories, the site will provide a way to view products by brand/manufacturer. A dedicated “Brands” menu or page will list popular robotics companies (e.g. Unitree, Boston Dynamics, UBTech, Deep Robotics, etc.). Each brand page will show all products from that manufacturer. This appeals to users loyal to certain brands or researchers looking for models from a specific company.
	•	Search Functionality: A search bar will be featured prominently (likely in the header) to let users quickly look up a specific robot model or feature. This supports power-users who know exactly what they want. Even without a backend, search can be implemented using a client-side script that scans product names and keywords in the static data.

Product Listings with Filtering and Sorting

When users browse a category or brand page, they will see a product listing grid or list. To handle potentially dozens or hundreds of products, robust filtering and sorting tools will be provided:
	•	Filtering Options: Users can narrow down lists by various criteria. For example:
	•	By Brand: On a category page (e.g. Humanoids), a filter could let users show only Unitree vs. UBTech robots.
	•	By Key Specs: Depending on data available, filters for specs like battery life, payload capacity, sensor types (LiDAR, cameras), or capabilities (e.g. arm manipulation, autonomous navigation) can be added, especially for advanced users or researchers seeking specific features.
	•	Sorting Options: Users will be able to sort the product list by relevant parameters. Common sorting choices include Price (Low to High or High to Low), Newest Arrivals, and Alphabetical (A–Z by name). Other useful sorts might be Popularity (if we track which items get the most clicks or affiliate purchases) or Rating (if user reviews/ratings are present). Sorting helps users organize results in a way that suits their intent – for instance, a teacher might sort humanoid robots by lowest price to find budget-friendly options, whereas a tech enthusiast might sort by newest to see the latest releases.
	•	Importance of Filter/Sort UX: Effective filtering and sorting are proven to dramatically improve product-finding success. Research shows that the design of product lists, combined with good filters and sort tools, directly impacts how easily users can find what they need ￼. In fact, “E-commerce product lists and their filtering and sorting tools determine how easy or difficult it is for the user to browse the site’s product catalog” ￼. By providing intuitive filters (e.g. checkboxes, sliders) and clear sort controls, the site will enable users to quickly drill down to a handful of products that meet their criteria, rather than forcing them to scroll through irrelevant items. This is especially important as the catalog grows.
	•	No Backend Implementation: All filtering/sorting will be handled on the client side (in the browser). This can be achieved by storing product data (like specifications, price, categories) in a static JSON or JavaScript object and using front-end code to filter the list in real-time when the user selects options. This approach avoids any server-side processing, aligning with the “no backend” requirement. Modern static site frameworks or libraries can facilitate this. The result is a fast, responsive filtering experience without page reloads.

Detailed Product Pages (PDPs)

Each robot or accessory will have its own Product Detail Page (PDP) containing comprehensive information. The PDP serves to educate the visitor about the product and convince them it’s worth clicking through to purchase. According to e-commerce best practices, “the purpose of a product detail page is to inform potential customers about a product’s features, specifications, pricing, and other relevant details” ￼. With that in mind, our PDPs will include:
	•	Product Name and Overview: A clear title (e.g. “Unitree G1 Humanoid Robot”) and a short intro paragraph highlighting what the robot is and its primary appeal. For example, mention if it’s designed for education, research, entertainment, etc., to set context.
	•	High-Quality Images & Media: Visuals are vital for tech products. Each page will showcase multiple images of the robot from different angles (and in different contexts, if possible – e.g. a quadruped robot shown traversing terrain). We might include an image gallery or carousel. If available, videos (embedded from YouTube or similar) demonstrating the robot in action will greatly enhance user understanding and engagement. Providing “crisp imagery” and even interactive media can help users virtually experience the product ￼. This is especially important since users cannot physically handle the robots; rich media bridges that gap.
	•	Specifications and Features: A detailed breakdown of the robot’s technical specs and capabilities. This should be neatly organized (bullet points or a table for readability). Key specs include dimensions, weight, battery life, load capacity, degrees of freedom, sensors (cameras, LiDAR, etc.), processors/AI capabilities, and included accessories. Any unique features or USP (unique selling points) should be highlighted (e.g. “First humanoid under $100k with 40+ degrees of freedom”, or “Integrates with ROS for programming”). By listing technical details like this, we answer users’ questions up front and aid informed decision-making ￼.
	•	Pricing and Availability: The page will indicate a quotation button to a form that will be filled out by the user and sent to the designed google form.
	•	Related Products and Accessories: On each product page, we will show suggestions for other items. For example, on a humanoid robot page, it might list related accessories (spare batteries, compatible charger, replacement parts, or add-ons like a sensor module). On an accessory page, it could link to the main robots that accessory works with. This cross-linking improves navigation and may lead to additional affiliate clicks. It also improves the user experience by showing the ecosystem around a product (e.g. a user looking at a robot dog might not know there’s a compatible charging dock or carry case – we can highlight that). Since we’re not handling a cart, these suggestions serve to help users consider all they might need and click out to those items as well.
	•	Technical Documentation Links: For the audience likely to buy AI robots (researchers, educators, hobbyists), having access to documentation is important. We can provide links to the official product manuals, SDK documentation, or developer resources if they are publicly available. This is more of a value-add content feature that positions our site as a thorough resource, not just a storefront. (These could reside in a “Resources” tab on the PDP or simply under a section like “Documentation and Support”.)

Educational Blog and Tutorials Section

To complement the product listings, the website will feature a Blog section filled with educational and informative content. This serves multiple purposes: attracting organic traffic via SEO, educating potential customers (which builds trust), and providing additional contexts in which to embed affiliate links naturally. In fact, high-quality content is a cornerstone of successful affiliate sites – “the most successful affiliate websites prioritize high-quality, SEO-optimized content that drives consistent organic traffic” ￼. Here’s how we’ll implement the blog:
	•	Content Types: We will create a mix of content tailored to our audience:
	•	News and Updates: Posts about the latest developments in robotics (e.g. “New Humanoid Robot Announced at Tech Expo 2025” or “Boston Dynamics releases update for Spot robot”). This positions our site as up-to-date and can draw readers interested in current events. These may not directly sell products, but they bring in enthusiasts who might then browse other pages.
	•	Educational Tutorials: How-to guides and tutorials related to robotics. For instance, “How to Get Started with Programming Your Quadruped Robot”, or “5 Tips for Maintaining Your Humanoid Robot”. These would be especially useful for those who already own robots or are seriously considering one. Within these tutorials, we can mention products and link to them (soft-selling). For example, a tutorial on programming might list a recommended IDE or a sensor add-on (with affiliate link to that accessory).
	•	Buying Guides and Top-Lists: These are classic affiliate content pieces. Titles like “Top 5 Robot Dogs for Home Use” or “Humanoid Robots Comparison: Which Should You Buy?” will directly target purchase-oriented queries. In these articles, we compare multiple products (which are in our catalog), discussing pros and cons. We will include affiliate link buttons or hyperlinks for each item when first mentioned. For SEO, these listicles and comparison posts can rank well for queries like “best X robot”. According to Affilorama, affiliate sites often use product reviews, buying guides, and top lists as content that naturally integrates affiliate links ￼.
	•	Case Studies/Use Cases: Perhaps blog posts that showcase how a robot is used in real life. E.g., “How XYZ University Uses the UBTech Humanoid in Their Engineering Program” or “A Day in the Life of a Quadruped Robot at a Warehouse”. These narrative-style posts can engage readers and subtly advertise the capabilities of the robots.
	•	Tutorial Series: We might have multi-part series (especially if “Others” category includes DIY kits or educational kits, we could do a series on building a robot or learning ROS (Robot Operating System) basics). This kind of content draws educators and students, reinforcing our site’s value beyond just sales.
