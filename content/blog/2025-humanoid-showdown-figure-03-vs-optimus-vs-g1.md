2025 marks a pivotal year for humanoid robotics with major advances from Figure AI, Tesla, and Unitree. This comparison examines the latest platforms: [Figure 03](/robots/figure-03), [Tesla Optimus Gen 3](/robots/tesla-optimus-gen-3), and [Unitree G1](/robots/unitree-g1).

## Quick Verdict

**Available Now:** Unitree G1 ($16,000-$43,000)
**Most Advanced AI:** Figure 03 (Partner only)
**Mass Market Potential:** Tesla Optimus Gen 3 (~$20,000, limited availability)

## 2025 Platform Overview

| Feature | Figure 03 | Tesla Optimus Gen 3 | Unitree G1 |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Status** | Development | Limited production | Available |
| **Price** | Unknown | ~$20,000 | $16,000-$43,000 |
| **AI Integration** | OpenAI partnership | Tesla FSD AI | Standard/GPT |
| **Manufacturing** | Startup scale | Automotive scale | Robotics scale |
| **Target** | Enterprise | Consumer/Industrial | Research/Dev |

## Key Differentiators

### Figure 03
- **Next-gen AI reasoning** from OpenAI partnership
- **Enterprise deployment focus**
- Not available for general purchase

### Tesla Optimus Gen 3
- **Mass manufacturing** potential
- **Consumer pricing** target
- Uncertain availability timeline

### Unitree G1
- **Available today** with proven capability
- **Strong developer ecosystem**
- **Multiple configurations** for different needs

## The Reality Check

While Figure 03 and Optimus Gen 3 generate significant excitement, **Unitree G1 remains the only platform you can actually buy and deploy in 2025**.

For researchers, developers, and organizations needing results now, G1 offers:
- Immediate availability
- Proven performance
- Active community
- Clear upgrade path

## Recommendation

**Start with G1 today, evaluate next-gen platforms as they become available.** The fundamentals you learn—locomotion, manipulation, perception—will transfer to any platform.

Don't wait for vaporware when capable hardware is available now.
