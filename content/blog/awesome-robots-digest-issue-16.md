## Conclusion 🎯

CES 2026 will be remembered as the year robotics transitioned from "impressive demos" to "available for purchase." The convergence of affordable pricing (Dobot at $1,030), consumer brand credibility (LG Electronics), regulatory approval (FDA clearance for LEM Dynamis), and on-device AI (SwitchBot's cloud-free approach) addresses the four major barriers that held back mainstream adoption. We're witnessing the iPhone moment for robotics—not because of a single revolutionary device, but because the ecosystem has matured to the point where robots can finally deliver on decade-old promises.

What aspect of the CES 2026 robotics announcements excites you most? The affordability breakthrough, the home automation potential, or the surgical precision advances? Share your thoughts as we continue tracking these robots from announcement to real-world deployment throughout 2026.
