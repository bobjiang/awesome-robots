As the global race to build AI computing infrastructure intensifies, DEWALT and August Robotics have unveiled a game-changing solution: the world's first autonomous, fleet-capable downward drilling robot designed specifically for data center construction. This isn't just another construction tool—it's a glimpse into how robotics is solving one of the biggest bottlenecks in the $7 trillion AI infrastructure boom.

## The Data Center Construction Crisis

With more than 400 data centers currently in development worldwide and hyperscalers (the tech giants powering AI computing) accounting for nearly 80% of global demand, the construction industry faces an unprecedented challenge. Traditional concrete drilling methods—one of the most labor-intensive, time-sensitive, and physically demanding tasks in data center builds—simply can't scale fast enough.

Enter DEWALT's robotic drilling solution, built on August Robotics' proven Lionel autonomous mobile robot platform. After completing 10 pilot phases with one of the world's largest tech companies, the system has demonstrated performance that's rewriting the economics of large-scale construction.

## Breakthrough Performance Metrics

### Speed: 10x Faster Than Traditional Methods

The autonomous drilling robot operates at speeds up to **10 times faster** than conventional manual crews. Across 10 data center projects with a leading hyperscaler, the fleet-capable system delivered:

- **80 weeks** of cumulative schedule savings
- **90,000+ holes** drilled with near-perfect precision
- **Continuous day-and-night** autonomous operation

For context: a typical data center requires thousands of precisely placed holes for server rack stops and structural supports for overhead mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems. What once took 8-9 weeks with manual crews can now be compressed to 7-9 days with a four-robot fleet.

### Accuracy: 99.97% Precision

Throughout its pilot deployment, the system achieved **99.97% accuracy** in both hole placement and depth across more than 90,000 holes—a level of consistency nearly impossible to maintain with human crews over such high volumes.

**Technical specifications:**
- **Placement tolerance:** ±1/8 inch (3.175 mm)
- **CAD-driven navigation:** Direct import of drilling plans eliminates manual layout
- **Autonomous positioning:** Indoor positioning system for precise navigation
- **Obstacle avoidance:** Multi-angle approach capability when blocked

### Cost: $60 to $20 Per Hole

The economics are staggering. Traditional manual drilling costs approximately **$60 per hole** when factoring in labor, layout time, equipment, and delays. DEWALT's autonomous system reduces this to approximately **$20 per hole**—a 67% cost reduction.

**ROI breakdown:**
- **21,000 labor hours** saved in the first six months of early access
- Eliminates 8-9 weeks of manual layout work per project
