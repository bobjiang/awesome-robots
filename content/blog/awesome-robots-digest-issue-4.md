## Trends to Watch üîç

1. **Valuation vs Reality**: With Figure's $39B valuation, increasing scrutiny on whether companies can deliver safe, usable humanoids at scale, not just flashy demos

2. **Torque/Physical Constraints in Learning**: Research like TA-VLA emphasizes integrating physical feedback/safety into learned models, counterbalancing over-reliance on perception systems

3. **Hybrid Hardware/Competitions as Test Platforms**: Competitions becoming standard competence check-ins for motion, robustness, control under disturbance, and endurance

## Conclusion üéØ

Issue #4 reinforces the theme that humanoid robotics is no longer just exciting proposals and vision‚Äîscale, validation, and robustness are now under the spotlight. Big money is flowing, but expectations are rising. If you're building humanoids or generalist VLA stacks, the next 2-3 months will likely be decisive: either hardware, data, control, and safety converge‚Äîor the gap between hype and field performance opens up.

Looking ahead: I'll keep an eye on results from CoRL and Humanoids (papers, open-source), Tesla / Apptronik / Figure's deployment signals, and ways for smaller labs to piggyback on infrastructure (simulation, safety tools, modular morphology).
