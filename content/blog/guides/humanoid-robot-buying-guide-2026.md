## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

1. **2026 is the right time to buy:** Technology has matured significantly, prices have dropped 40% year-over-year, and commercial platforms are finally production-ready.

2. **Start with entry-level unless you have specific enterprise needs:** Unitree G1 ($16K-$43K) offers 80% of the capability of platforms costing $100K+, with a vibrant developer community.

3. **Budget for total cost of ownership:** Multiply purchase price by 1.5-2× for realistic 3-year costs including training, support, and maintenance.

4. **Prioritize software ecosystem over hardware specs:** ROS2 support and community size matter more than DOF count or walking speed for long-term success.

5. **Pilot before scaling:** Buy one, test for 6 months, validate your use case, then scale. 40-60% of first deployments fail - learn cheaply.
