## Decision Framework: Choosing the Right Quadruped Robot

Selecting a quadruped robot requires balancing eight critical factors specific to four-legged platforms:

### 1. Terrain Capability and Mobility

**The Most Critical Factor for Quadrupeds**

Unlike humanoids focused on manipulation, quadrupeds are chosen for mobility. Evaluate terrain capability carefully:

**Terrain Categories:**
- **Flat indoor (office/warehouse):** Any platform works, even consumer-grade
- **Stairs (standard commercial):** Requires minimum 12 DOF, proven stair-climbing
- **Rough terrain (gravel, grass):** Needs IP54+ rating, adaptive gait control
- **Extreme terrain (mud, snow, slopes >20°):** Premium platforms only (Spot, ANYmal, B2)

**Mobility Specifications:**
- **Walking Speed:** 0.5-2.0 m/s typical; faster isn't always better (stability trade-off)
- **Stair Climbing:** Max slope capability (30-45° for industrial platforms)
- **Obstacle Height:** Maximum step height (15-30 cm typical)
- **Ground Clearance:** Critical for rough terrain (10-20 cm typical)

**Real-World Testing Required:**
Test on YOUR terrain before purchasing. A platform rated for "rough terrain" may struggle with your specific surface conditions (mud vs. gravel vs. ice performs very differently).

### 2. Payload Capacity and Mounting Options

**Payload determines what sensors/equipment you can deploy:**

**Payload Tiers:**
- **Hobbyist (0-2 kg):** Basic cameras only
- **Consumer/Research (2-5 kg):** HD cameras, LiDAR, small sensors
- **Industrial (5-15 kg):** Thermal cameras, gas sensors, robotic arms
- **Heavy Industrial (15-30 kg):** Multi-sensor suites, manipulation equipment

**Mounting Considerations:**
- **Mounting points:** Standard rails vs. custom fabrication required
- **Power availability:** 12V/24V outputs for sensors
- **Data integration:** Ethernet, USB, CAN bus for sensor connectivity
- **Vibration isolation:** Critical for optical sensors

**Common Payloads:**
