## ROI Calculation Framework

### Labor Cost Displacement Model

**Assumptions for Warehouse Picking Use Case:**

**Human Baseline:**
- Average warehouse associate: $18/hour + $9/hour benefits = $27/hour total
- Annual cost (2,080 hours): $56,160
- Productivity: 100 picks/hour (baseline)
- Annual picks per worker: 208,000

**Humanoid Robot Performance (2026 Reality):**
- Average pick rate: 40-60 picks/hour (40-60% of human baseline)
- Uptime: 60-75% (first year), 75-85% (years 2-3)
- Operating hours: 16-20 hours/day (two shifts)
- Annual effective picks: 100,000 - 150,000 (0.5-0.75 human equivalent)

**Labor Displacement Calculation:**
```
Robot Annual Operating Cost = $47,000 (Figure 02 TCO/year)
Human Labor Displaced = 0.6 FTE (realistic performance)
Annual Labor Savings = 0.6 × $56,160 = $33,696
Net Annual Cost = $47,000 - $33,696 = $13,304 (negative ROI year 1)

Break-even Year: Year 2-3 (as uptime improves and amortization reduces annual cost)
5-Year NPV: Breakeven to +$50K (assuming performance improvement trajectory)
```

**Critical Reality:** Most warehouse humanoid deployments do NOT achieve positive ROI in first 2 years. ROI materializes in years 3-5 as reliability improves and upfront costs amortize.

### Manufacturing Assembly ROI Framework

**Assumptions for Light Manufacturing:**

**Human Baseline:**
- Assembly technician: $25/hour + $13/hour benefits = $38/hour
- Annual cost: $79,040
- Productivity: 150 units/day (baseline)
- Quality: 98% first-pass yield

**Humanoid Robot Performance:**
- Assembly rate: 60-90 units/day (40-60% of human)
- Uptime: 70-80% (specialized tasks, higher reliability)
- Quality: 99.5% first-pass yield (advantage: consistency)
- Operating cost: $51,000/year (including quality improvement value)

**Value Proposition:**
- Labor displacement: 0.5 FTE = $39,520/year
- Quality improvement value: $5,000 - $10,000/year (reduced rework)
- Total annual benefit: $44,520 - $49,520
- Net cost year 1: $1,500 - $6,500 (marginal negative)
- Years 2-5: $10,000 - $20,000 positive annually

**Payback Period:** 18-30 months for manufacturing applications (better than warehouse due to quality benefits)

### Productivity Gain Scenarios

**Optimistic Scenario (Top 20% Deployments):**
- Robot achieves 75% human productivity
- 85% uptime by year 2
- Minimal process disruption
- Strong vendor support
- **Result:** 24-month payback, $150K+ 5-year NPV

**Realistic Scenario (Median Deployment):**
- Robot achieves 50-60% human productivity
- 75% uptime by year 2
- Moderate integration challenges
- Standard vendor support
- **Result:** 36-48 month payback, $25K-$75K 5-year NPV

**Pessimistic Scenario (Bottom 30% Deployments):**
- Robot achieves 40% human productivity
- 60% uptime (persistent reliability issues)
- Significant process re-engineering needed
- Limited vendor support responsiveness
- **Result:** No payback within 5 years, negative NPV

**Distribution:**
- 20% of deployments: Optimistic outcome
- 50% of deployments: Realistic outcome
- 30% of deployments: Pessimistic outcome or failure

### Beyond Labor: Strategic Value Calculation

**Non-Labor Benefits (Harder to Quantify but Real):**

1. **24/7 Operation Capability**
   - Value: Enables night shift without premium labor costs
   - Quantification: $15,000 - $40,000/year (facility-dependent)

2. **Worker Safety Improvement**
   - Value: Reduces workplace injuries in hazardous tasks
   - Quantification: $5,000 - $25,000/year (insurance, workers' comp)

3. **Process Standardization**
   - Value: Consistent execution, reduced variability
   - Quantification: $10,000 - $30,000/year (quality improvement)

4. **Competitive Differentiation**
   - Value: Marketing, customer perception, innovation leadership

5. **Data Collection & Analytics**
   - Value: Operational insights from robot sensors/data
   - Quantification: $5,000 - $20,000/year (process optimization)

**Total Strategic Value:** $35,000 - $115,000 annually (varies widely by use case)

**Adjusted ROI Including Strategic Value:**
- Median deployment ROI improves by 30-50%
- Payback period reduces to 24-36 months (from 36-48 months)
- 5-year NPV improves to $100K - $150K range
