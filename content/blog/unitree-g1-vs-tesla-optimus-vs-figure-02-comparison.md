- **Strong payload** capacity (20+ kg)
- **Tesla's AI expertise** (FSD neural networks)
- **Manufacturing scale** potential for low cost
- **Battery technology** from EV expertise

**Limitations:**
- **Not yet available** for purchase
- **Unknown SDK/developer support**
- **Uncertain timeline** for general availability
- **Limited third-party ecosystem**

**Best For:** Those willing to wait for potential mass-market pricing

### 3. Figure 02: AI-First Design

Figure AI has attracted significant attention with advanced AI demonstrations and major partnerships (OpenAI, BMW).

**Strengths:**
- **Advanced AI** integration and reasoning
- **Strong manipulation** capabilities
- **High-profile partnerships** (OpenAI, Microsoft)
- **Significant funding** ($675M+ raised)
- **Enterprise focus** with real deployment pilots

**Limitations:**
- **Not available** for general purchase
- **Enterprise/partner only** access
- **Unknown pricing** (likely $50K+)
- **Proprietary ecosystem**

**Best For:** Enterprise partners and well-funded research institutions

## Key Decision Factors

### Availability Timeline

| Robot | Current Status | General Availability |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Unitree G1 | **Available now** | Shipping globally |
| Tesla Optimus | Prototype/pilot | 2025-2026 (estimated) |
| Figure 02 | Partner deployments | Unknown |

**Winner: Unitree G1** - The only option you can buy today

### Developer Experience

**Unitree G1:**
- Comprehensive Python SDK
- Full ROS2 integration
- Isaac Sim simulation
- Active GitHub community
- Regular firmware updates

**Tesla Optimus:**
- Unknown developer tools
- Likely proprietary system
- Potential for FSD-style API

**Figure 02:**
- Proprietary AI stack
- Limited external access
- Enterprise API potential

**Winner: Unitree G1** - Mature, open developer ecosystem

### Use Case Alignment

| Use Case | Best Choice | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| University research | Unitree G1 | Available, affordable, ROS2 |
| AI/ML development | Unitree G1 | SDK access, simulation support |
| Industrial pilot | Figure 02 | Enterprise partnerships |
| Mass deployment (future) | Tesla Optimus | Scale manufacturing |
| Education | Unitree G1 | Cost, documentation, community |

### Total Cost of Ownership

**Unitree G1 (3-year estimate):**
- Robot (Enterprise): $43,000
- Training/setup: $5,000
- Maintenance: $3,000
- Total: ~$51,000

**Tesla Optimus (projected):**
- Robot: $20,000-30,000
- Unknown support costs
- Uncertain maintenance model

**Figure 02:**
- Enterprise pricing (likely $100K+)
- Custom integration costs
- Premium support model

## Recommendations by User Type

### For Researchers & Academics
**Choose: Unitree G1 EDU or Enterprise**

The G1 offers immediate access to a capable platform with strong documentation and community support. The modular pricing lets you start with EDU ($16K) and upgrade as needed.

### For Startups & Developers
**Choose: Unitree G1 Enterprise**

If you're building products or services on humanoid platforms, the G1's mature SDK and active development community make it the practical choice. Don't wait for vaporware.

### For Enterprise/Industry
**Consider: Figure 02 partnership or wait for Optimus**

Large enterprises may benefit from Figure's partnership model or waiting for Tesla's mass-market approach, but be prepared for higher costs and longer timelines.

### For Hobbyists
**Choose: Unitree G1 EDU or wait for Optimus**

The G1 EDU at $16K is the most accessible entry point today. If budget is critical, waiting for Tesla's consumer pricing might make sense, but timeline is uncertain.

## The Bigger Picture

### Market Dynamics

The humanoid robot market is bifurcating:

1. **Available platforms** (Unitree, UBTech) - Shipping now, known capabilities
2. **Announced platforms** (Tesla, Figure, 1X) - High potential, uncertain timeline

For most buyers in 2025, the choice is clear: buy what's available and proven, or wait indefinitely for announcements to become products.

### Technology Trajectory

All three companies are advancing rapidly:
- **Unitree** releases major updates every 6-12 months
- **Tesla** leverages automotive AI and manufacturing
- **Figure** focuses on AI reasoning and enterprise integration

The "best" robot in 2027 may be very different from today's options.

## Conclusion

**For buyers who need a humanoid robot in 2025, the [Unitree G1](/robots/unitree-g1) is the clear choice.** It's the only platform in this comparison that you can actually purchase, with proven capabilities, strong developer support, and a growing ecosystem.

Tesla Optimus and Figure 02 represent exciting future possibilities, but until they're available for general purchase with clear developer tools, they remain aspirational rather than practical options.

The best strategy: **Start with a G1 today, learn the fundamentals, and be ready to evaluate next-generation platforms when they become available.**
