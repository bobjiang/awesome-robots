- **"Admissible Strategies" for Safe Human-Robot Teams ‚Äì Lahijanian et al., IJCAI 2025:** Researchers at University of Colorado Boulder introduced a game-theoretic approach to help robots collaborate safely with humans in unpredictable environments. Instead of optimizing for a robot to "win" (finish its task at all costs), the algorithm seeks an "admissible strategy," maximizing task completion while minimizing potential harm to humans.

- **Autonomous Breeding Robot ‚Äì Xu et al., Cell (CAS Institute):** A team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences published a groundbreaking paper in Cell detailing GEAIR, a robotic system for plant hybrid breeding. Combining robotics, AI vision, and biotechnology, GEAIR autonomously performs tasks like selecting parent plants, pollinating flowers, and managing growth environments ‚Äì essentially automating the entire crop breeding pipeline.

### üîß Open Source Projects
- **MolmoAct ‚Äì Open 3D Reasoning for Robots (Allen AI):** The Allen Institute for AI released MolmoAct, an open-source AI model that lets robots understand and act in 3D space. MolmoAct is built on a vision-language foundation model (AI2's Molmo) and extends it into an Action Reasoning Model (ARM).

- **NASA JPL Visual Perception Engine (VPE):** NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab open-sourced a Visual Perception Engine designed for rover and robot vision. VPE is a fast, flexible framework that can run multiple perception models concurrently on resource-constrained hardware (like the NVIDIA Jetson platform).
