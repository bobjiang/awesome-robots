- **Industries**: Initially Tesla manufacturing, future general commercial

**Recommendation**: If you need humanoid robots in 2026, pursue Figure AI partnership. If you can wait until 2027+, Tesla Optimus may offer better economics. Monitor both companies' announcements for availability updates.

**Q: What are the risks of early adoption?**

A: Both platforms carry early-adoption risks typical of emerging technology:

**Technical Risks**:
- **Unproven reliability**: Even Figure 02's BMW deployment is relatively new (2024)
- **Performance variation**: Real-world performance may not match demonstrations
- **Integration challenges**: Humanoid robots require workflow redesign and facility adaptation
- **Maintenance unknowns**: Long-term maintenance costs and component lifecycles are uncertain

**Business Risks**:
- **Vendor stability**: While both companies are well-funded, robotics is challenging and timelines slip
- **Technology obsolescence**: Rapid advancement could make early units outdated quickly
- **Limited ecosystem**: Few third-party developers, integrators, or service providers
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Safety standards and regulations for humanoid robots are still evolving

**Financial Risks**:
- **High upfront costs**: Significant investment with uncertain ROI timelines
- **Hidden costs**: Integration, training, and change management often exceed initial estimates
- **Pricing uncertainty**: Especially for Optimus, actual commercial pricing may differ from targets

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Start with pilot deployments (1-3 robots) to validate performance and ROI
- Choose well-defined, high-value tasks with clear success metrics
- Build internal robotics expertise rather than relying entirely on vendors
- Plan for longer-than-expected integration timelines and be prepared to adapt workflows

Early adopters gain competitive advantages but must accept higher risk and investment compared to waiting for mature, proven technology.
