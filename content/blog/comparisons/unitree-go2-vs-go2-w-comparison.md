## Model Positioning and Design Philosophy

### Unitree Go2: Traditional Quadruped Excellence

The Go2 represents Unitree's consumer-focused quadruped robot, positioning itself as an accessible platform for research, education, and AI experimentation. It uses pure legged locomotion—all movement is achieved through coordinated leg articulation across 12 aluminum knee joint motors.

**Target Users**:
- University robotics labs teaching legged locomotion
- AI researchers developing embodied intelligence
- Hobbyists exploring quadruped control systems
- Educational institutions with moderate budgets ($1,600-$3,500)

The three-tier pricing model (AIR/PRO/EDU) allows buyers to scale capabilities based on needs. The AIR variant ($1,600) provides basic quadruped functionality, while the EDU model ($3,500) adds foot-end force sensors and extended battery life for serious research applications.

### Unitree Go2-W: Hybrid Mobility Pioneer

The Go2-W represents Unitree's exploration of wheeled-leg hybrid design, adding 7-inch pneumatic wheels to the standard Go2 platform. This isn't simply "Go2 with wheels"—it's a fundamentally different mobility approach that combines rolling efficiency on smooth surfaces with powered wheel climbing on obstacles.

**Target Users**:
- Security patrol applications crossing varied terrain
- Industrial inspection requiring stair/obstacle navigation
- Research labs studying hybrid locomotion strategies
- Commercial deployments needing speed + climbing versatility

The higher stance (43cm vs 31cm) and additional in-wheel motors increase the robot's ground clearance and vertical obstacle capability, trading some legged agility for rolling speed and climbing power.

## Technical Differences Deep Dive

### Mobility Systems: Legs vs Wheels + Legs

**Go2 Pure Legged Locomotion**:
- 12 aluminum knee joint motors provide 3 DOF per leg
- Max joint torque enables 15-16cm step climbing
- Movement speed: 2.5-5 m/s depending on gait and terrain
- Energy efficiency: Optimized for walking gaits, less efficient at high speeds
- Terrain adaptability: Excellent on uneven natural terrain, stairs, obstacles within height limit

The Go2's legged system excels in environments where traditional wheels fail—rocky terrain, narrow stairs, uneven ground with debris. However, it's mechanically complex and slower on flat surfaces compared to wheeled systems.

**Go2-W Wheeled-Leg Hybrid**:
- 16 aluminum knee joint motors (4 additional motors for enhanced stability)
- In-wheel motors provide direct drive to 7-inch pneumatic tires
- Hybrid modes: Rolling on smooth surfaces, powered wheel climbing on obstacles
- Max obstacle climb: **70cm vertical clearance** using combined wheel power + leg articulation
- Energy efficiency: Superior on flat surfaces when rolling, higher power draw during climbing

The hybrid design allows the Go2-W to switch between rolling (energy-efficient cruising) and climbing (powered wheel ascent). The 7-inch pneumatic tires provide shock absorption and traction across concrete, asphalt, grass, and gravel.

### Obstacle Climbing Capability: The 4.4× Difference

This is where the Go2-W's engineering advantage becomes undeniable.

**Go2 Obstacle Limits**:
- Max step height: 15-16cm (6.3 inches)
- Climb angle: 30-40° depending on model variant
- Method: Leg articulation lifting body over obstacles
- Real-world limits: Standard stairs (~18cm rise) are challenging
- Success rate: High on low curbs, parking lot barriers, small debris

**Go2-W Obstacle Capability**:
- Max climb height: **70cm (27.6 inches)**
- Climb angle: 35° on slopes
- Method: Powered wheels + leg stabilization + body angle adjustment
- Real-world capability: Full-height stairs, loading docks, vertical barriers
- Success rate: Extremely high on obstacles that would completely block Go2

To put 70cm in perspective:
- Standard stair rise: 18cm (Go2-W climbs 3.9× this height)
- ADA wheelchair ramp max rise: 76cm (Go2-W approaches this limit)
- Typical loading dock height: 45-60cm (Go2-W exceeds requirements)

This capability fundamentally changes deployment scenarios. Security patrol robots can navigate multi-level facilities without ramps. Inspection robots can climb onto platforms, equipment, and structures inaccessible to pure legged quadrupeds.

### Speed and Efficiency Trade-offs

**Go2 Speed Characteristics**:
- Walking speed: 2.5-5 m/s (9-18 km/h)
- Fastest gait: High-speed trot at 5 m/s
- Energy consumption: Moderate during normal walking, high during running
- Surface dependency: Speed decreases on rough terrain
- Typical deployment speed: 1-2 m/s for stable navigation

**Go2-W Speed Characteristics**:
- Rolling speed: 0-2.5 m/s (0-9 km/h)
- Climbing speed: Significantly slower when ascending obstacles
- Energy consumption: Low during rolling, high during powered climbing
- Surface dependency: Fast on smooth surfaces, slower on rough terrain requiring leg stabilization
- Typical deployment speed: 1.5-2 m/s on mixed indoor/outdoor routes

The Go2 has a higher theoretical top speed (5 m/s vs 2.5 m/s), but the Go2-W achieves more consistent speeds on varied terrain by switching between rolling and walking modes. For patrol routes mixing hallways, outdoor concrete, and occasional stairs, the Go2-W maintains better average speed despite lower peak velocity.

### Physical Specifications and Implications

**Dimensions and Weight**:
- Go2: 70cm × 31cm × 40cm, ~15kg
- Go2-W: 70cm × 43cm × 50cm, ~18kg
- Height difference: 43cm vs 31cm stance (38% taller)
- Weight increase: 3kg (20% heavier)

The Go2-W's taller stance (43cm) provides three advantages:
1. **Ground clearance**: Higher body means wheels can tackle larger obstacles before body contact
2. **Sensor positioning**: Elevated LiDAR and cameras see farther and over obstacles
3. **Payload mounting**: More vertical space for equipment racks, inspection tools, sensor packages

The 3kg weight increase comes from:
- 7-inch pneumatic wheels (4× wheels + mounting hardware)
- Additional 4 joint motors for enhanced stability

- Use case: Short research sessions, classroom demonstrations, brief patrol routes

**Go2-W Battery**:
- Standard: 15000mAh lithium battery
- Runtime: 1.5-3 hours
- Charging: Fast charge (33.6V 9A)
- Use case: Extended patrol routes, full shift inspection tasks

The Go2-W's standard 15000mAh battery matches the Go2 EDU's extended battery, but runtime is slightly lower (1.5-3h vs 2-4h) due to:
- Higher weight (18kg vs 15kg)
- Additional motors and in-wheel drives consuming power
- Frequent climbing operations requiring peak power draw

For deployment planning, assume:
- Go2: 1.5-2 hours continuous operation (PRO model)
- Go2-W: 2-2.5 hours mixed operation (rolling + occasional climbing)
- Both: Reduce runtime by 20-30% for challenging terrain or heavy payloads

- Custom SDK development
- Python/C++ programming
- OTA software updates
- WiFi 6, Bluetooth, 4G connectivity

The Go2-W's hybrid control is more complex (wheel motors + leg coordination), requiring additional development effort for custom locomotion algorithms.

### 7. What payload capacity do I need for inspection cameras?

- **Go2**: 7-8kg typical, up to 10-12kg max (depending on model)
- **Go2-W**: 8kg typical, up to 12kg max

A typical inspection payload (camera + gimbal + compute + sensors) weighs 3-5kg, well within both platforms' capabilities. Choose based on mobility requirements (climbing capability, speed) rather than payload limits.

### 8. How loud are the motors during operation?

Both platforms produce motor noise during operation:
- **Go2**: Moderate noise from 12 leg motors during walking (60-70 dB estimated)
- **Go2-W**: Lower noise during rolling (40-50 dB), similar noise during climbing
