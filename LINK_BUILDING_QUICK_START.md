Subject: Resource for Your Robotics Students - Comprehensive Robot Catalog

Hi Professor [Name],

I came across your [course name/research lab] at [University] and thought you and your students might find this resource valuable.

I've built Awesome Robots (awesomerobots.xyz), a comprehensive catalog of 115+ AI-powered humanoid and quadruped robots. It's designed to help students and researchers:

‚Ä¢ Compare specifications across all major manufacturers (Unitree, Boston Dynamics, UBTech, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Understand pricing and budget planning for research grants
‚Ä¢ Access technical buying guides
‚Ä¢ Learn about different robot platforms before choosing for projects

The site might be particularly useful for students working on [specific course/research area you saw on their website].

Example resources:
‚Ä¢ Full catalog with filtering: https://www.awesomerobots.xyz/browse
‚Ä¢ Buying guide: https://www.awesomerobots.xyz/compare/best-humanoid-robots-under-50000
‚Ä¢ Technical comparisons: https://www.awesomerobots.xyz/compare/humanoid-vs-quadruped

Would you consider sharing this with your students or adding it to your course resources page? I'm happy to create any custom content that would be helpful for [University] students.

Thank you for your time, and keep up the great work in robotics education!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Awesome Robots
[Your Email]

P.S. - All resources are completely free. This is a passion project to help the robotics community.
```

#### Target These First (Highest Response Rate):

1. **Smaller universities** (more responsive than MIT/Stanford initially)
2. **Junior faculty** (more likely to respond than department heads)
3. **Lab managers** (often maintain resource pages)
4. **Instructors of intro courses** (need resources for beginners)

#### Step 3: Follow Up (5 min per email)

After 7-10 days, send short follow-up:

```
Hi Professor [Name],

Just following up on my email from last week about Awesome Robots, a free catalog of robotics platforms.

I understand you're busy, but wanted to check if this might be useful for your students. No pressure at all!

Happy to answer any questions.

Best,
[Your Name]
```
