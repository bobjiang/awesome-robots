  {
    question: "What types of robots are available in the catalog?",
    answer: "Our catalog includes humanoid robots, quadruped robots, accessories, and other specialized robotic systems. Popular categories include educational robots for learning and research, professional platforms for development and testing, and industrial automation solutions. Each category serves different purposes from basic education to advanced research and commercial applications."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose between different robot brands?",
    answer: "Consider your specific use case, budget constraints, technical requirements, and support needs. Educational users often prefer cost-effective options like Unitree Go2, while industrial applications may benefit from premium brands like Boston Dynamics or Deep Robotics. Research institutions typically need platforms with strong SDK support and active communities, while commercial users prioritize reliability and professional support."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the typical price range for AI robots?",
    answer: "Robot prices vary significantly based on capabilities and target market. Entry-level quadrupeds start around $1,600 (Unitree Go2), professional models range from $15,000-$50,000, and advanced humanoids can cost $150,000 or more. Accessories and sensors add $500-$5,000 depending on specifications. Always contact manufacturers directly for current pricing and volume discounts."
  },
  {
    question: "Do these robots require programming knowledge?",
    answer: "Most modern robots offer multiple interaction levels to accommodate different skill levels. Basic operation often requires minimal programming, while advanced features may need Python, ROS (Robot Operating System), or manufacturer-specific SDKs. Many include graphical programming interfaces for beginners, drag-and-drop environments for intermediate users, and full API access for advanced developers."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between humanoid and quadruped robots?",
    answer: "Humanoid robots have human-like bipedal structure, making them ideal for tasks in human environments but more complex to control. Quadruped robots offer superior stability and mobility over varied terrain, making them perfect for outdoor applications, inspection tasks, and situations requiring dynamic movement. Choice depends on your specific application requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do robot batteries typically last?",
    answer: "Battery life varies greatly based on robot size, activity level, and usage patterns. Small quadrupeds like Unitree Go2 provide 2-4 hours of operation, while larger robots may offer 1-2 hours of continuous use. Most professional robots support hot-swappable batteries or charging stations for extended operation. Consider your use case duration when selecting a platform."
  },
  {
    question: "What support and maintenance do robots require?",
    answer: "Modern robots require regular software updates, occasional hardware maintenance, and proper storage conditions. Professional brands offer technical support, training programs, and replacement parts. Community-supported platforms rely on forums and documentation. Budget for ongoing costs including software licenses, replacement components, and potential repair services."
  },
  {
    question: "Can robots be customized for specific applications?",
    answer: "Yes, most professional robots support customization through additional sensors, custom software development, and hardware modifications. Manufacturers often provide SDK access, mounting points for accessories, and integration services. Educational platforms typically offer more open architectures, while industrial robots may require certified modifications for safety compliance."
