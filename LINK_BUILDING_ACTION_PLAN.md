## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

|--------|---------|--------|--------|------|
| Total Backlinks | 2 | | | 30+ |

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Batch your work**: Do all directory submissions in one 3-hour session
2. **Personalize manufacturer outreach**: Reference specific models and features
3. **Follow up**: Send follow-up emails after 7-10 days (50% of results come from follow-ups)
4. **Track everything**: Use spreadsheet to track status, dates, responses
5. **Quality over quantity**: One backlink from MIT > 10 from low-quality directories
6. **Be patient**: Links take 2-4 weeks to show in Google Search Console

---

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

- **Never buy backlinks** - Google penalties are severe
- **Avoid link farms** - Focus on relevant, quality sites
- **Natural anchor text** - Use "Awesome Robots", "robot catalog", or URL (not keyword stuffing)
- **Add value first** - Contribute to communities before asking for links
- **Track rejections** - Learn what works and iterate

---

## Next Steps After Month 1

Once you hit 30 backlinks:
1. Analyze which link sources drove most traffic
2. Double down on highest-performing channels
3. Move to Month 2 goals: 100-150 backlinks total
4. Add content marketing (guest posts, case studies)
